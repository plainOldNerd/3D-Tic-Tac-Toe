# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe

In my subject Software Architecture Design and Implementation the second assignment required networking functionality. I had a severe bug in this assignment and decided I had best figure out networking, so I programmed this for that reason.

I was also interested in applets at the time.

The game is not my best work with regards to how it stores the data but it does handle all network errors. When a player loads a new applet window it will handle the situation of being mid-game, etc.
